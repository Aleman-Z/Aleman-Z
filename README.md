## 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

I’m **Dr. Adrián Alemán-Zapata**, a Neuroscientist and Engineer passionate about **sleep, memory, and technology**.  
My work bridges neuroscience and engineering — from rodent electrophysiology and behavioral tracking to AI systems for neurotech and health applications.

## 🧠 Research Focus

I study how the brain consolidates memories during sleep by analyzing hippocampal–cortical dynamics.  
My research integrates **large-scale electrophysiology**, **signal processing**, and **engineering** to uncover how neural oscillations (ripples, spindles, deltas) support learning and memory.

**Keywords:** Sleep • Memory • Ripple Subtypes • LFP • Spike Sorting • Machine Learning • Ephys
