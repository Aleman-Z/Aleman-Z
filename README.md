## 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm **Dr. Adrián Alemán-Zapata**, a Neuroscientist and Engineer passionate about memory, sleep, and brain-inspired technology.

I explore how the brain consolidates memories during sleep using electrophysiology and computational tools. My work bridges neuroscience and engineering, with a focus on hippocampal-neocortical interactions, closed-loop neurostimulation, and AI for behavior analysis.
